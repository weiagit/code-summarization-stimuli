1. **`initBody` Method Summary:**
   - The `initBody` method configures the HTTP request body for a given request specification (`WebClient.RequestBodySpec`) based on the `HttpRequestNodeBody` type.
   - It handles various body types such as NONE, RAW_TEXT, JSON, X_WWW_FORM_URLENCODED, FORM_DATA, and BINARY.
   - It performs variable replacement within the body data using the current state.
   - Errors are thrown if preconditions for specific body types (e.g., expecting a single item for RAW_TEXT) are not met.

2. Bug Identification:
   ```
   yes
   logic error
   ```

   - **Bug Explanation:**
     - Within the INIT_BODY method, there's a logic error in the `FORM_DATA` case where there is an incorrect line attempting to read `jsonTemplate`, which is not defined within the `FORM_DATA` context. The line `jsonObject = new ObjectMapper().readValue(jsonTemplate, Object.class);` appears to be misplaced as it is unnecessary in this context.
     - The correct usage should involve handling only form data without referencing JSON parsing logic inadvertently.
