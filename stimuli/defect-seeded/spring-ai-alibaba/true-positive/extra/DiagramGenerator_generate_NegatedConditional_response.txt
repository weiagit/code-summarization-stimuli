(1) **Code Comment Summary for `generate`:**

The `generate` method creates a textual representation of a graph by appending headers, processing nodes and edges, and appending a footer to the output. It handles subgraphs, declares nodes, manages conditional and parallel edges, and initializes calls based on edge conditions. The method returns a `Context` object containing the formatted graph.

- Yes
- Logical bug

The line `else if (!edgeStart.target().id() != null)` has incorrect logic and should be `else if (edgeStart.target().id() != null)`.
