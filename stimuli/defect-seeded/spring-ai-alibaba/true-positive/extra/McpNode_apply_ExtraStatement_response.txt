(1) **Method `apply` Summary:**

The `apply` method initializes a synchronous MCP client with the specified URL and headers, replacing variables in the configuration using the provided `OverAllState`. It then constructs a `CallToolRequest` with the specified tool and parameters, calls the tool, and processes the result to update the state with the response content, logging each step.

(2) Bug Identification:

Yes  
Duplicate Call Bug  

**Explanation:**  
The method calls `client.callTool(request)` twice in succession without utilizing the first result. Ensure that the result from the tool call is used correctly. The duplicated call should be removed or correctly utilized.

Here is the corrected section:

```java
result = client.callTool(request);
log.info("[McpNode] tool call result: {}", result);
```
This ensures only one call is made and logged.
