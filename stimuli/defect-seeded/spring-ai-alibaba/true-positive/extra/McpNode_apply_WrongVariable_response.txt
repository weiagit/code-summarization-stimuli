1. **Code Comment Summary for the `apply` Method:**

```

2. **Bug Identification:**

```
yes
Logical bug
```

**Explanation:**

In the `apply` method, the following line:

```java
if (value != null) {
    finalParams.put(key, result);
}
```

Wrongly assigns `result` instead of `value` to `finalParams.put(key, ...)`. The correct assignment should use `value`, as `result` hasn't been defined yet at this point in the code:

```java
if (value != null) {
    finalParams.put(key, value);
}
```
