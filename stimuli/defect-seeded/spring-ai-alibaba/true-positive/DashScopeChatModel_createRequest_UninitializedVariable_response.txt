(1) **Summary of `createRequest` Method:**
The `createRequest` method constructs a `ChatCompletionRequest` from the given `Prompt`. It processes the prompt's messages and converts them into a list of `ChatCompletionMessage` objects. Depending on the message type, it handles user, system, assistant, and tool messages differently, including media content conversion and tool call handling. The method also merges runtime options with default options to ensure the request parameters are accurately configured for the chat API call. Support for streaming and various configurations like model, temperature, and token settings are included.

(2) **Bug Identification:**
yes
Incorrect variable usage

The `createRequest` method references `requestOptions` without initializing it before using it to resolve tool definitions and set request parameters. The variable `requestOptions` should be initialized with merged options before it is used in the method.
