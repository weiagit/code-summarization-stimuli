(1) **executeToolCall Method Summary:**

The `executeToolCall` method is responsible for executing tool calls by interacting with tool callbacks, capturing observations, and processing tool execution results, including handling exceptions. It identifies the necessary tool callback for each tool call, executes it, and manages the tool result within an observation context. Results are aggregated into tool response messages used in further processing.

Type of bug: **Potential Bug in Tool Callback Resolution**

Explanation:
In the `executeToolCall` method, inside the loop iterating over `assistantMessage.getToolCalls()`, the `toolCallbacks` variable is initialized as an empty list `List.of()`. It should use `toolCallbacks`, which seems to be a typo as it attempts to resolve `toolCallback`, which is undefined in this context. Instead, it should be `toolCallbacks`.
