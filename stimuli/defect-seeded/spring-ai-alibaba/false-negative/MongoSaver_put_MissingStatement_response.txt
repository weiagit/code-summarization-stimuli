(1) **Code Comment Summary for the `put` Method:**

The `put` method adds or updates a `Checkpoint` in a MongoDB collection associated with a given configuration identified by `threadId`. If the specified `Checkpoint` ID already exists, it replaces the existing `Checkpoint`; otherwise, it adds the new `Checkpoint` to the beginning of the list. The method operates within a transaction, ensuring data integrity, and returns an updated `RunnableConfig` with the saved `Checkpoint` ID.
