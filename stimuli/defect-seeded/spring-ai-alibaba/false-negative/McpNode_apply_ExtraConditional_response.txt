(1) **Code Comment Summary for the `apply` Method:**

The `apply` method in the `McpNode` class is used to execute a request to an MCP server, performing variable replacements with the provided state. It initiates a transport and client using specified URL and headers, prepares the tool and parameters with input keys and replacements, and makes a synchronous call to the MCP service. The method processes the result, updating the state with received content mapped to defined keys. It handles exceptions by logging errors and wrapping them in a custom `McpNodeException`.
