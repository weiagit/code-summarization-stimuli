(1) **Summary of `afterWorkbookDispose` Method:**

The `afterWorkbookDispose` method in the `DimensionWorkbookWriteHandler` class addresses the issue of writing dimensions in an SXSSFWorkbook. It checks if the workbook and its sheets are valid SXSSFWorkbook and SXSSFSheet instances. For each valid sheet, it extracts the underlying XSSFSheet using reflection, and updates the worksheet's dimension reference based on calculated header size and last row index. If any expected data or field is missing, it logs debug information and continues processing other sheets.

Logical error

-In the method, the check for `xssfSheet` being null occurs after accessing it with `getCTWorksheet()`, which could lead to a `NullPointerException`. The null check for `xssfSheet` should be moved before calling `getCTWorksheet()`.
