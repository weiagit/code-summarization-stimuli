1. **Code Comment Summary for `buildChain`:**

   The `buildChain` method adds the specified `WriteHandler` to the appropriate execution chain, depending on the handler's type (Cell, Row, Sheet, or Workbook). It also determines if the handler should be added to the instance's handler list for later execution. When `runOwn` is true, it populates the instance-specific (own) execution chains; otherwise, it updates the general execution chains.
