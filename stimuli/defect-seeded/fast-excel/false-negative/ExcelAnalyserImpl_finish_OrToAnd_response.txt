(1) **Code Comment Summary for the method `finish`:**

The `finish` method is responsible for cleaning up resources after analyzing an Excel file. It prevents multiple shutdown operations and releases memory by closing streams, destroying caches, and deleting temporary files specific to the type of Excel workbook in use (XLS, XLSX, CSV). If any exceptions occur during this process, they are thrown in an `ExcelAnalysisException` to ensure proper error handling.
