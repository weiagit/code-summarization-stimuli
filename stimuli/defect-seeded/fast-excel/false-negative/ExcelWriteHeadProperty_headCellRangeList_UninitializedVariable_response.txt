Explanation: Upon reviewing the provided code, it seems to correctly implement the logic for merging header cells based on their names. The algorithm processes each header cell, checks for contiguous cells with the same name, and tracks processed cells to prevent duplication. Thus, there doesn't appear to be a violation of correctness.
