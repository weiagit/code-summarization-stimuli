(1) **Code Comment Summary for `createCellStyle` Method:**

The `createCellStyle` method constructs a new cell style for an Excel workbook. If a `WriteCellStyle` is provided, it generates or retrieves a cached `CellStyle`, applying specified customizations such as data format and font from the style definition. The method supports optimization by checking existing styles and reusing them if possible. It handles both new cell styles and modifications of existing ones, considering conditions like the data type of the cells to handle date formats specifically.

Caching Bug

The bug is related to the method `createCellStyle`. The caching mechanism does not account for `originCellStyle` modifications accurately. Once the `originCellStyle` is used, the cache should only reuse a `CellStyle` if all properties, including fonts and data formats, match precisely. However, the cache may return an incorrect style if variations exist within distinct `WriteCellStyle` instances sharing the same `styleIndex`.
