(1) **Code Comment Summary for `afterWorkbookDispose`:**

The `afterWorkbookDispose` method checks if the workbook holder and its associated workbook are non-null and compatible with `SXSSFWorkbook`. It then iterates over initialized sheets to retrieve an internal `XSSFSheet` object using reflection. For each sheet, it calculates the effective range from the sheet head map and last row index, updating the worksheet dimension reference accordingly.

(2) **Bug Identification:**

Reflection Bug

The bug is in the reflection usage of `XSSF_SHEET_FIELD.get(sxssfSheet)`. This can cause an `IllegalAccessException` if permissions are restricted. Additionally, if the `XSSF_SHEET_FIELD` is not correctly retrieved from `SXSSFSheet`, it will lead to runtime errors. Proper error handling is critical for robustness.
