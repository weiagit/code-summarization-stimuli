Initialization bug

The bug is in the `fillImage` method, specifically in the initialization of the `drawing` object. `sheet.getDrawingPatriarch()` might return `null`, and although `drawing` is then initialized, further usage does not take null safety into account, which could lead to `NullPointerException`.
```
