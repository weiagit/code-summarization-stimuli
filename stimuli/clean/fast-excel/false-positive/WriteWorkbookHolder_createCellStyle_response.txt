(1) **Code Comment Summary for `createCellStyle` Method:**

The `createCellStyle` method creates a new cell style for an Excel workbook. It takes parameters for a `WriteCellStyle`, an optional `originCellStyle`, and a `cellDataType`. If a style already exists in the cache, it returns that; otherwise, it creates a new style using `StyleUtil`, applies data formats and fonts if necessary, and caches the new style for reuse. Special handling is applied if the cell type is a date format.

Cache Inconsistency Bug

The bug is located in the `createCellStyle` method. The `styleIndex` is initialized to -1, which is used as a key in `cellStyleIndexMap`. If `originCellStyle` is null, this could lead to cache inconsistency because it doesn't distinguish between different cell styles when the `originCellStyle` is missing or the same across different calls.

To fix the bug, ensure `styleIndex` is assigned a valid or unique value that respects the presence or absence of `originCellStyle`. Consider using other attributes to form a composite key for caching when `originCellStyle` is null.
