Reflection misuse bug

**Summary of `afterWorkbookDispose`:**

The `afterWorkbookDispose` method in the `DimensionWorkbookWriteHandler` class ensures proper dimension handling for Excel sheets in an SXSSFWorkbook. It processes each initialized sheet, casting and utilizing reflection to access internal fields of the sheet to update the worksheet's dimension reference based on the head map size and last row index. 

1. **Reflection Misuse Bug:** There is potential for a reflection access issue with `XSSF_SHEET_FIELD`, as `Field.get()` may throw an `IllegalAccessException` if permissions are not properly configured. The code currently logs and continues, potentially leaving the worksheet dimensions improperly set.

2. **Accurate Summary:** The method accurately retrieves and sets the sheet dimensions, considering existing header and row data.

3. **Important Details:** The method processes only if the workbook is of type `SXSSFWorkbook` and each sheet needs to be an `SXSSFSheet`.

4. **Unnecessary Information:** None. The summary is concise and focused on key operations.

5. **Readability:** The summary is structured and uses clear technological terms related to Excel operations.

6. **Bug Explanation:** The issue lies in the use of reflection to access the non-public field `_sh` of `SXSSFSheet`. If the environment does not allow reflection access, it could fail silently, impacting the expected update of sheet dimensions.
