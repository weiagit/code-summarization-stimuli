(1) **Code Comment Summary for `buildChain` method**

The `buildChain` method initializes and maintains execution chains for different types of write handlers, specifically `CellWriteHandler`, `RowWriteHandler`, `SheetWriteHandler`, and `WorkbookWriteHandler`. It checks if these handlers are applicable for the current execution context (`runOwn`) and adds them to the respective chain (`cellHandlerExecutionChain`, `rowHandlerExecutionChain`, etc.). If `runOwn` is true, it handles the "own" chains separately (`ownSheetHandlerExecutionChain`, etc.). It ensures the handlers are added in order and updates the class's `writeHandlerList`.

(2) **Bug Identification**

yes

There is a potential issue related to thread safety in the method `sortAndClearUpHandler` and the usage of class-level variables such as `writeHandlerList`. If multiple threads access this shared object, it can lead to concurrent modification exceptions or inconsistent behavior. Ensure proper synchronization or use thread-safe data structures if this code is intended to be accessed by multiple threads concurrently.
