(1) **Code Comment Summary for `afterWorkbookDispose` Method:**

The `afterWorkbookDispose` method addresses an issue related to writing dimensions in an Excel workbook. It operates on a `WriteWorkbookHolder` object, checking if it is non-null and an instance of `SXSSFWorkbook`. It iterates through the initialized sheets in the workbook, ensuring each sheet is a valid `SXSSFSheet` and attempts to access its underlying `XSSFSheet` using reflection. For each valid sheet, it calculates the header size and the last row index to set the dimension ref attribute appropriately on the `CTWorksheet` object. Logging is included for error handling.
