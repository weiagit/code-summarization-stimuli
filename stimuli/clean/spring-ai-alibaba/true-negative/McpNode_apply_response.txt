(1) **Code Comment Summary for `apply` Method:**

The `apply` method in the `McpNode` class executes a request to an MCP server. It initializes a client connection, processes parameters by replacing variables using the provided `OverAllState`, and constructs the final request. It then executes the request with the MCP client and processes the result. The result is used to update the state, which is then returned. The method includes logging for tracing execution steps and potential errors.
