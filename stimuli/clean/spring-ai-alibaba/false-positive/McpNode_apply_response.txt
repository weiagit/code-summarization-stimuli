(1) **Code Comment Summary for `apply` Method:**

The `apply` method initializes and configures an MCP (Model Context Protocol) client to perform a tool call. It replaces template variables in the configuration using the current state, assembles parameters, and attempts the tool call. Upon success, it processes and updates the result in the state map, potentially extracting specific fields based on the output configuration. The method also includes robust logging for traceability and detailed error handling for call failures.

(2) **Potential Bug Identification:**

yes

Reference to a possible bug: 
The method uses an initialized `client` to make a call and handles the exception with a custom exception class `McpNodeException`. However, there might be a bug with resource cleanup. Once `client` and `transport` are no longer needed, they should be closed or released to prevent resource leaks. Ensure proper cleanup after the try-catch block.
