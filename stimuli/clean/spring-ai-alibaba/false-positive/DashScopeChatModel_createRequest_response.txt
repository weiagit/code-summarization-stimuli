**(1) Code Comment Summary for the Method `createRequest.java`:**

The `createRequest` method constructs a `ChatCompletionRequest` object using provided `Prompt` data. It processes messages and options from the `prompt`, categorizing them based on their message type (e.g., USER, SYSTEM, ASSISTANT, TOOL) and converting any media content if present. Tool definitions are resolved and added to the request options. The method also accommodates streaming requests by configuring the parameters accordingly. The function returns a complete `ChatCompletionRequest` object ready for execution.

**(2) Identify whether any method in the class contains a bug.**

yes

Type of Bug:
The `createRequest` method incorrectly uses the enum `ChatCompletionMessage.Role.valueOf` without handling exceptions for unsupported message types. If a new message type (like an unexpected or undefined type) is encountered, it may result in a `IllegalArgumentException`. Instead, it should safely handle or default to prevent runtime failures.
