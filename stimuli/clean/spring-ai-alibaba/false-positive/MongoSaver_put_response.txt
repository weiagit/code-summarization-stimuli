### Code Comment Summary for `put` Method

The `put` method in the `MongoSaver` class is responsible for storing a `Checkpoint` associated with a `RunnableConfig` in a MongoDB collection. The method first checks if a `threadId` is present in the `RunnableConfig`. It starts a transaction to interact with the MongoDB collection. If a document corresponding to the `configOption` exists, it replaces the checkpoint in the list if the checkpoint ID matches. If the document does not exist, it creates a new one, inserting the checkpoint. The method ensures the MongoDB session and transaction are managed properly. Finally, it returns an updated `RunnableConfig` with the new checkpoint ID.

### Bug Identification

yes

### Bug Explanation

The bug is related to the premature closing of the `clientSession` in the `put` method. The `clientSession.close()` is called right after committing the transaction when replacing a checkpoint, which is redundant and out of sync with how it is handled in other parts of the function (in the finally block). This could be unintended behavior, and the `clientSession.close()` should only be in the finally block for consistency and proper resource management.
